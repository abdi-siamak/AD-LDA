player amount time get plate appearance now player sum atbat baserunning value season obtain overall value player obviously sum player value game season whole will thats always credit batter pitcher theres validation involve theres big problem nobody yet comment youre add probability probability add run can add total team run break many run joe contribute plus many run fred contribute etc probability work way bob increase team chance win mean bob increase team chance win fact doesnt mean anything unit screwy agree disagree john say batter effort will result win loss probably correct mean win loss mean something rather player increase team chance win player increase chance win thus appear obvious positive association johns statistic win game thus disregard stat appear study must sort relationship consider example bob hit solo bottom first scale thing score tie another score tie another finally win game score value bob hit solo plate appearance credit method mean bob responsible win certainly defense always responsible include pitch bob wasnt pitch fact bob offense lot even close furthermore team run say come solo fred fred hit tie game just valuable take lead see lindsey fred will accrue good rate fred bob combine amass win one game theres clearly problem problem insistance numb mean exactly many win team first use average many season apply one game remember player performance take away chance win player get get negative probability case thus sure give game add numb team win will add game sometimes will add one sometime little one also pitcher bad performance give run may give large negative percentage game also batter pull night give large negative greg think right thing intuition mark close enormously important total numb run value outweigh come prevent comming double greg allow enough another article propose test can predict team wonlost record quite accurately look many run total score allow without regard run score game late run really important early run look late run lead good predictor right really small sample size think however numb run score first inning just good prediction many run score last inning realize something else close usually come close situation blow hard argue run close give game equal importance give first inning look close give run often mean team will lose many game hand starter give run often still leave team chance win offence many something say late inning situation equally important either run really matter many run pitcher give heres another think experiment apply method basketball find point score first half game almost exactly value lead safe entire half yet play furthermore sub bench sink win free throw time clock get game star forward score point first half sprain ankle get zero make sense assume team probability win possesion free throw make look point 2 leave fairly high probability will win game possesion ball forget somebody elses miss shoot turnover foul bad defense etc cause negative chance team win read discussion statistic feel critisize certain extent agendum first look statistic valadates clutchness really cluthness revolve around idea certain player crucial situation elevate performance performance ive never see convince proof really happen assume clutchness mean except lot noice statistic positive association player performance way get rid noice believe clutchness certainly find average value home run example may find instance home run increase chance win average strikeout decrease chance win bet find statistic just good statistic predict win loss evaluate relief pitcher say john sam exact pitch statistic run earn run bbs etc exceptional numb john however pitch close situation sam mop man valuble team probably john good pitcher probably brian
